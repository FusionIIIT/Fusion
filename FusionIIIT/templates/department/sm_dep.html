                            Our Mission :
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            The programme is designed to provide various tools and techniques associated with IoT,
                            IIoT, Information and Computing Technology (ICT) and System Engineering, with special
                            focus on additive manufacturing (AM) or 3D printing and near net shape manufacturing
                            processes.
                        </p>
                        <h3>
                            Our Vision :
                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            This programme focuses on some of the disruptive innovations that the last decade has been
                            witnessed to, namely, Internet of Things (IoT), Robotics, Additive Manufacturing (3D
                            Printing), Industrial Automation, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, etc. These
                            technologies have a huge potential to shape the future of mankind.
                            Smart manufacturing, being an important aspect of the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is
                            the next industrial revolution. Smart manufacturing integrates data and information from
                            multiple open and vendor applications and products to form new solutions. It can be applied
                            to a single machine line, an entire factory or across a network of manufacturers, suppliers and
                            customers. This new area of innovation will optimize the entire manufacturing industry to
                            create higher quality products at lower prices, improve productivity, increase energy
                            efficiency, and sustain safer plants.
